# Soil-Suitability-Prediction-for-Construction
This project uses machine learning to assess soil suitability for construction based on geotechnical factors. It involves data collection, preprocessing, EDA, and predictive modeling with Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The goal is to provide data-driven insights to support informed engineering decisions.
