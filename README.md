# Soil Suitability Prediction for Construction  

## Overview  
This project utilizes machine learning to assess soil suitability for construction based on geotechnical properties. By analyzing soil characteristics, we aim to provide data-driven insights to support informed engineering decisions.  

## Features  
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Handling raw soil data for effective analysis.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends in soil properties.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Applying machine learning techniques to classify soil suitability.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python main.py
